## Description
Daily planner calendar webpage (for current day) that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm). It has color-coded hour intervals to highlight current time of day, before, and after.<br>
The time slots are text fields for the activities of the day, which can be saved to local storage via save button and retrieved upon page load or refresh:  https://tonymagr.github.io/work-day-scheduler-3rd-party-apis/

Module 5 skills and tools that I used in webpage deployment were:
- HTML Access to CSS frameworks, jQuery library, and Day.js library
- Day.js formatting
- Dynamic styling updates with jQuery
- jQuery event listeners
- Use of JavaScript forEach method on all target DOM elements that are selected-All
  - Amninder Singh, classmate of Aug-23 FS Bootcamp, assisted me here

## Challenges
I attempted to listen for click events of the Save buttons of all time slots through event delegation on the work-schedule container div and use of event.target, but I was not able to access the element text. I received assistance from a classmate (in Credits below) and changed technique to JavaScript forEach method to loop through selected elements from querySelectorAll. This worked.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
Employees, managers, non-for-profit team members, and volunteers can use this Work Day Planner to save notable events by time and retrieve them later. It is good for class exercise, but a real-world improvement would be to expand this calendar to future and past days to maximize the use of the stored calendar information.

## Credits
Amninder Singh, classmate of Aug-23 FS Bootcamp, assisted me on the use of JavaScript forEach method on all target DOM elements that are selected-All. (In this case to detect a click event on any save button in the hourly calendar.)
